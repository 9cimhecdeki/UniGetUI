# Mi Robot Builder Apk
  
Creating a program with RobotBuilder is a very straight forward procedure by following a few steps that are the same for any robot. This lesson describes the steps that you can follow. You can find more details about each of these steps in subsequent sections of the document.
 
Your robot is naturally made up of a number of smaller systems like the drive trains, arms, shooters, collectors, manipulators, wrist joints, etc. You should look at the design of your robot and break it up into smaller, separately operated subsystems. In this particular example there is an elevator, a minibot alignment device, a gripper, and a camera system. In addition one might include the drive base. Each of these parts of the robot are separately controlled and make good candidates for subsystems.

PIDSubsystems - often it is desirable to control a subsystems operation with a PID controller. This is code in your program that makes the subsystem element, for example arm angle, more quickly to a desired position then stop when reaching it. PIDSubsystems have the PID Controller code built-in and are often more convenient then adding it yourself. PIDSubsystems have a sensor that determines when the device has reached the target position and an actuator (motor controller) that is driven to the setpoint.
 
Each subsystem consists of a number of actuators, sensors and controllers that it uses to perform its operations. These sensors and actuators are added to the subsystem with which they are associated. Each of the sensors and actuators comes from the RobotBuilder palette and is dragged to the appropriate subsystem. For each, there are usually other properties that must be set such as port numbers and other parameters specific to the component.
 
Command groups - these commands are a combination of other commands running both in a sequential order and in parallel. Use these to build up more complicated actions after you have a number of basic commands implemented.
 
The operator interface consists of joysticks, gamepads and other HID input devices. You can add operator interface components (joysticks, joystick buttons) to your program in RobotBuilder. It will automatically generate code that will initialize all of the components and allow them to be connected to commands.
 
Commands make it simple to develop autonomous programs. You simply specify which command should run when the robot enters the autonomous period and it will automatically be scheduled. If you have tested commands as discussed above, this should simply be a matter of choosing which command should run.
 
At any point in the process outlined above you can have RobotBuilder generate a C++ or Java program that will represent the project you have created. This is done by specifying the location of the project in the project properties (1), then clicking the appropriate toolbar button to generate the code (2).

Manoi AT01 fully assembled. View Slideshow TOKYO -- It came in an unmarked box -- and in many, many parts. As I leafed through the assembly schematics, an inch thick and in Japanese, I got that sinking feeling. But, oh, what I wouldn't do to ingratiate myself with our future robot overlords.
 
Now, for the first in a series of reviews on Ro-Bot-X's boards. This one is on version 2 of the Robot Builder's Shield for the Arduino. I provided a brief review in a comment on the original version. Many other LMR members provided contructive feedback to Gabriel (Ro-Bot-X) as well. I'm happy to say that he listened and incorporated many of the suggestions.
 
There is one important point to mention. Gabriel does a good job of explaining it in his assembly guide. If you use this shield with an Arduino or Arduino clone that uses the standard USB Type B connector, there is a risk of shorting out the power pins of the shield on the USB connector of the Arduino.
 
File down the solder joints of the power terminal on the bottom of the board as close as you can. Place electrical tape over them, or over the the USB connector, as I did in the picture below. (Ignore the sloppy soldering job.)
 
The integrated power switch and reset button are very handy. There's also a jumper so you can decide if you want the power from the battery terminals of the shield to connect to the Vin of the attached Arduino.
 
The board includes an area for prototyping. Two blocks of 4x16 through hole contacts are separated by a row of 16 contacts each for power and ground. The space is exactly large enough to fit a mini-breadboard, if you would prefer not to solder on the shield.
 
You can buy the bare board or the kit from using PayPal. Various shipping options are provided, if you are in a hurry and can spend the extra money for quicker shipping. There's an option to add tracking, even for the economy shipping, but that does add to the cost. (These are Canadian Post costs, not Ro-Bot-X's.)
 
This is a very easy and flexible shield for turning your Arduino or clone into a robot. It is well designed, well made, and fairly priced. The only thing that might be better would be to have all these features with an integrated Arduino. Speaking of that...

The objective of the puzzle is to determine which robot should be built on the console to operate the catapult at the correct distance. Successfully doing so will launch an egg into the nearby nest, lowering the klayblock into the mountainside. This, in turn, will allow the Zipkicker to travel further along the mountainside.

I don't have a 3D printer, so that really cuts down my possibilities quickly. I also suck with woodworking, metalworking, plasticworking, or anything else that needs to work together to be precise. I have seen openbeam, but this still just isn't enough to produce some projects that I want, such as robotic arm, a video camera motion control, or a sorting machine. What can I do? I also can't afford custom made parts or hiring anyone to produce things for me.
 
All I can say here is that you better start learning about one or more of those skills; start with wood first, then move on to plastic - leave metal for last (aluminum is pretty easy to work with, if you aren't trying to weld it - steel is easy to work with, even welding - but is pretty heavy stuff).
 
Let's say you want to build a simple robot base, and you have a couple of gearmotors and wheels to start with. Well, once you get the wheels attached to the gearmotors, then you need a base. A simple plywood base would be perfect.
 
Get a piece of plywood (doesn't have to be very large - 24" x 24" is fine) - 1/4" or 3/8" thick - and draw a circle. Then use a coping saw or a jigsaw to cut the circle out (follow the line on the outside of the line - you can use sandpaper after to even things up).
 
Position your motors on the base, note where the wheels are, and mark things out - so that the wheels can fit - each wheel in it's own slot. You can position the wheel at the outside edge (tangential to the edge), or inset them back a couple of inches from the edge. You'll either mark for an indent, or a slot - but whichever, mark it out, drill a starting hole (if needed), and cut it out. Again, use sandpaper, a file or rasp, even a dremel tool - to even things up.
 
Then re-position the motors, and get some u-bolts that will fit around the body of the gearmotor - place them over the motor with it in position, and mark where the holes need to be - then drill them out. Then test-fit the motors and u-bolts.
 
On the front and back, mount a small caster - you may need some spacers (washers) to get the caster level with the drive wheels - if it isn't perfect, leave it short - too tall and the drive wheels will have problems.
 
Drill some other holes to bring the motor wires up (a hole in the center of the circle would be perfect). For the rest of the chassis, you could use a few pieces of threaded rod and more plywood circles to make a couple of extra levels. Or - get a trashcan or bucket, and flip it upside down and mount it to the plywood.
 
Indeed - when you are at a store (hardware or housewares, etc) - look at stuff with the "eye of a robot builder" - and you will find all kinds of things that can be made into a robot (or parts of a robot).
 
Finally - get a copy of the first or second edition of Gordon McComb's book "Robot Builder's Bonanza" (indeed, if you can get copies of all of the editions, it would be best - but the early editions are very nice because they detail some old-school style robot chassis made from wood, metal, and plastic - with the assumption that you are a fair newbie at such construction).
